      <h2>What Is Baptism?</h2>
      <p>
        Baptism is a public way Jesus followers declare their decision to follow Jesus.
        A pastor or trusted friend stands with you in a baptism pool (or other body of water)
        and helps you lean back into the water and come right back up and out. They will then pray for you
        and usually there will be cheering and clapping!
      </p>

      <h2>Symbolism of Baptism</h2>
      <p>
        Why go underwater? It’s a symbol representing Jesus’ death, resurrection, and new life through Him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Leaning back under the water symbolises your sins being washed away through Jesus’ death.
        Being raised out of the water is a picture of being brought back to a new life, just as Jesus was raised.
      </p>

      <h2>Jesus' Baptism</h2>
      <p>
        Jesus then appeared, arriving at the Jordan River from Galilee. He wanted John to baptize him.
        John objected, “I’m the one who needs to be baptized, not you!” But Jesus insisted,
        “Do it. God’s work, putting things right all these centuries, is coming together right now in this baptism.”
      </p>
      <p>
        As Jesus came up out of the water, the skies opened up, the Spirit descended like a dove,
        and a voice declared: “This is my Son, chosen and marked by my love, delight of my life.” (Matthew 3:13-17 MSG)

      <h2>Reflect and Imagine</h2>
      <p>
        Now, reread the story and imagine yourself as the person being baptized by John.
        What’s the water like? How does it feel to hear God’s approval? What does God’s voice say to you specifically?
        How do you notice the Holy Spirit’s presence?
      </p>

      <h2>The Great Commission & Declaration</h2>
      <p>
        At the end of Jesus’ time on Earth, He gathered His followers and shared this mission:
        “Go out and train everyone you meet, far and near, in this way of life, marking them by baptism
        in the threefold name: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.” (Matthew 28:19 MSG)
      </p>
      <p>
        When you’ve said yes to Jesus’ way of life, baptism becomes a public declaration—
        a chance to invite your family, friends, and the whole church to celebrate what God has done.
      </p>

      <h2>How and When It Happens</h2>
      <p>
        We understand that some people may be anxious about being at the front or going under the water;
        don’t let this be a barrier. The baptismal pool is filled and you are invited to enter the water.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please wear clothing suitable for getting wet that won’t be see-through when wet.
        You need to bring: a towel, change of clothes, and a bag for the wet ones!
      </p>
      <p>
        You will also be asked to prepare your testimony—whether as a short passage, video clip,
        or with someone else reading it for you. Baptism usually happens during a Sunday morning service
        with your MBC Church family there to support and pray for you.
      </p>

        <strong>Pause to consider:</strong> What would it be like for you to take this next step of following Jesus?
        If you have further questions, please chat with Lou or another member of the leadership team.
