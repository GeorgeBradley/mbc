    <!-- Panel 1: What Is Baptism? -->
    <div class="panel">
      <h2>What Is Baptism?</h2>
      <p>Baptism is a public way Jesus followers declare their decision to follow Jesus. A pastor or trusted friend stands with you in a baptism pool (or other body of water) and helps you lean back into the water and come right back up and out. They will then pray for you and usually there will be cheering and clapping!</p>

    <!-- Panel 2: Symbolism -->
    <div class="panel">
      <h2>Symbolism</h2>
      <p>Why go underwater? It’s a symbol representing Jesus’ death, resurrection, and new life through Him.</p>
      <p>Leaning back under the water symbolises your sins being washed away through Jesus’ death. Being raised out of the water is a picture of being brought back to a new life, like Jesus was raised back to life.</p>
      <p>This public declaration of our new life with Jesus is similar to the way Jesus Himself was baptized.</p>

    <!-- Panel 3: Jesus' Baptism -->
    <div class="panel">
      <h2>Jesus' Baptism</h2>
      <p>Jesus then appeared, arriving at the Jordan River from Galilee. He wanted John to baptize him. John objected, “I’m the one who needs to be baptized, not you!” But Jesus insisted, “Do it. God’s work, putting things right all these centuries, is coming together right now in this baptism.”</p>
      <p>So John did it. The moment Jesus came up out of the baptismal waters, the skies opened up and he saw God’s Spirit—it looked like a dove—descending and landing on him. And along with the Spirit, a voice: “This is my Son, chosen and marked by my love, delight of my life.” (Matthew 3:13-17 MSG)</p>

    <!-- Panel 4: Reflection -->
    <div class="panel">
      <h2>Reflect & Imagine</h2>
      <p>Now, reread the story and imagine yourself as the person being baptized by John. What’s the water like? How does it feel to hear God’s approval? What does God’s voice say to you specifically? How do you notice the Holy Spirit’s presence?</p>

    </div>
    <!-- Panel 5: Great Commission & Declaration -->
    <div class="panel">
      <h2>Great Commission & Declaration</h2>
      <p>At the end of Jesus’ time on Earth, He gathered His followers together and shared this mission:</p>
      <p>“Go out and train everyone you meet, far and near, in this way of life, marking them by baptism in the threefold name: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.” (Matthew 28:19 MSG)</p>
      <p>When you’ve said yes to Jesus’ way of life, baptism is one of the next steps the Bible encourages us to take. It’s a public declaration that says to the world, “I have decided to follow Jesus!” It’s a great opportunity to invite your family and friends (as well as the rest of the church) to celebrate what God has done for you. It will be a special and joyful time for both you and everyone else present.</p>

    </div>
    <!-- Panel 6: How & When It Happens -->
    <div class="panel">
      <h2>How & When It Happens</h2>
      <p>We understand that some people are particularly anxious about being at the front or about going under the water but don’t let this be a barrier – there is flexibility about how we do this. The baptismal pool is filled and you are invited to enter the water.</p>
      <p>It is best to wear clothing suitable for getting wet that will not be see-through when it gets wet. You need to bring:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A towel</li>
        <li>Change of clothes</li>
        <li>A bag for the wet ones!</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You will be asked to prepare the story (Testimony) of how and why you felt you wanted to be Baptised. This can be done in a variety of ways: a short passage to read, a video clip—and it doesn’t have to be read by you if you feel you can’t.</p>
      <p>It usually happens during a Sunday morning service and your MBC Church family will be there to support and pray for you from that moment and for the rest of your journey with God.</p>
      <p><strong>Pause to consider:</strong> What would it be like for you to take this next step of following Jesus? If you have further questions, please chat to Lou or someone else on the leadership team.</p>
