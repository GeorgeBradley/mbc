            <h1>What Is Baptism?</h1>
            <p>A public way Jesus followers declare their decision to follow Him. A pastor or trusted friend stands with you in a baptism pool (or other water), immersing you as you lean back and rise up, symbolizing Jesus’ death, resurrection, and new life. We celebrate with prayer, cheering, and clapping from your MBC Church family!</p>

        <!-- Middle Panel (Center - Main Content) -->
        <div class="panel middle">
            <h2>Why Baptism?</h2>
            <p>It’s a symbol of Jesus’ death, resurrection, and new life through Him. Leaning back under the water signifies your sins being washed away through Jesus’ death. Being raised out of the water pictures your new life, like Jesus’ resurrection. This public declaration mirrors how Jesus Himself was baptized.</p>
            <div class="icon">[Icon: Water]</div>
            <h3>Jesus’ Baptism</h3>
            <p>“Jesus then appeared, arriving at the Jordan River… John baptized Him, and the skies opened, with God’s Spirit descending like a dove and a voice saying, ‘This is my Son, chosen and marked by my love, delight of my life.’ — Matthew 3:13-17 MSG”</p>
            <p>Now, reread the story and imagine yourself as the person being baptized by John. What’s the water like? How does it feel to hear God’s approval? What does God’s voice say to you specifically? How do you notice the Holy Spirit’s presence?</p>
            <div class="icon">[Icon: Cross]</div>
            <h3>Jesus’ Mission</h3>
            <p>“Go out and train everyone you meet, far and near, in this way of life, marking them by baptism in the threefold name: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.” — Matthew 28:19 MSG</p>
            <p>When you’ve said yes to Jesus’ way, baptism is a next step the Bible encourages.</p>

            <h2>How & When It Happens</h2>
            <p>Baptism usually happens during a Sunday morning service at Milton Baptist Church. Your MBC Church family will support and pray for you from that moment and for the rest of your journey with God.</p>
            <h3>What to Bring</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Towel</li>
                <li>Change of clothes</li>
                <li>Bag for wet clothes</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Wear clothing suitable for getting wet that won’t be see-through when wet. If you’re anxious about being at the front or going underwater, don’t worry—there’s flexibility in how we do it.</p>
            <div class="icon">[Icon: Towel]</div>
            <h3>Your Testimony</h3>
            <p>Prepare your story of how and why you felt called to be baptized. This can be a short passage to read, a video clip, or read by someone else if you prefer—it’s flexible!</p>
            <div class="icon">[Icon: Speech Bubble]</div>
            <h3>Next Steps</h3>
            <p>It’s a great opportunity to invite your family and friends (and the rest of the church) to celebrate what God has done for you. It’ll be a special and joyful time for you and everyone present. If you have further questions, please chat to Rev. Dr. Lou Luft or someone else on the leadership team.</p>
